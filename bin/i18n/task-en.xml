      Sends email(s) with a link to and/or attachment of the workflow document to recipients specified by the first input.
    </long>
    <inputs>
      <input>
        The first input, which is required, specifies the email recipient(s).  It may be multi-valued.
        Each value may specify an eclipse User or Group.  If a Group, the email is sent to each member.
        Optionally, each may be an email address, which is not that of an eclipse User; in this case, the document is attached to the email rather than being included as a link.
      </input>
      <input>
        The first optional input (the second input overall) replaces the format code {1} in the subject and/or body.
      </input>
      <input>
        Additional optional inputs replace {2}, {3}, etc.  There must be enough inputs to replace all specified format codes.
        See Advanced Format Task for more information.
      </input>
    </inputs>
    <settings>
      <setting name="set_splitRecipients">
        The first input (or each value thereof, if multi-valued) is split on each comma or semi-colon.  Thereby, it may contain a delimited list of Groups, Users, and (optionally) other email addresses.
      </setting>
      <setting name="set_overrideUserNotify">
        If checked, this message is sent immediately even if the user has elected to suppress notifications or receive daily digests.
        This setting applies only to Eclipse Users.

        Specifies the subject line of the email message.  The format code, {0}, is replaced with the document title.
        Additional format codes, {1}, {2}. etc. are replaced with optional inputs.
      </setting>
      <setting name="set_Body">
        Specifies the body of the email message.  The format code, {0}, is replaced with the document title.
        Additional format codes, {1}, {2}. etc. are replaced with optional inputs.
      </setting>

  <task name="SplitOnBarcodesTask">
    <short>
      Splits a document on barcodes, creating new documents.
    </short>
    <long>
      Splits a document on either a specific barcode or on all barcodes. Settings control what barcodes are used to split, what content type is applied to new documents created from this task, and how their titles are built.
      Note that the original document is deleted if the first page is a qualifying barcode.  Otherwise, the first document is left with any pages which preceed the first qualifying barcode.
    </long>
    <inputs>
      <input>
        Optional inputs may be used to specify the title of each new document.  There must be as many inputs as there are format codes specified in the Title setting.

    <settings>
      <setting name="SplitMethod">
        Controls what barcodes cause a split to occur:
        Specific Barcode: A split will only occur when a barcode matching the 'Text' setting is found; other barcodes are ignored.
        Any Barcode: Any barcode detected will cause a split to occur.
        Barcode = Content Type: A split will occur on any barcode. The content type assigned will be based on the barcode text. If this text doesn't match a content type, the Content Type setting is used.
      </setting>
      <setting name="ContentType">
        Content type to assign to each document created by the split, unless the Split Method is 'Barcode = Content Type', in which case this is the content type applied when the barcode text doesn't match any content type.
      </setting>
      <setting name="Region">
        Specifies an area to detect barcodes. If not specified the entire page is searched.
      </setting>
      <setting name="Title">
        Defines the title for each new document created. It may includes format codes similar to the Advanced Format Task.
        {0} is replaced with a sequential number, beginning with 1, assigned to each document created.  {1}, {2}, etc. are replaced with the corresponding optional inputs.
        If left blank, each created document is given the original document's title plus its sequence number.
      </setting>
      <setting name="RemoveBarcodeCoverSheet">
        If true, the barcode pages which cause splits are removed.  If not, each will be the first page of a new document.

  <task name="SplitOnBlanksTask">
    <short>
      Splits a document on blank pages, creating new documents.
    </short>
    <long>
      Splits a document on blank pages. Settings control what content type is applied to new documents created from this task, and how their titles are built.
      Note that the original document is deleted if the first page is a blank.  Otherwise, the first document is left with any pages which preceed the first blank.
    </long>
    <inputs>
      <input>
        Optional inputs may be used to specify the title of each new document.  There must be as many inputs as there are format codes specified in the Title setting.

    <outputs>
      <output>
        Optional, receives the number of documents created by this task.

      <setting name="ContentType">
        Content type to assign to each document created by the split.
      </setting>
      <setting name="Margin">
        Specifies a margin, in pixels, which is ignored when detecting blank pages.  A margin is recommended because scanned pages very often have shadows on one or more edges.
        Accepts a single integer value (e.g. 8).
      </setting>
      <setting name="Threshold">
        Specified the minimum size, in pixels, that a mark must be to recognized -- thereby making a page non-blank.  A threshold is specified because even a blank page will have some stray speckles.
      </setting>
      <setting name="Title">
        Defines the title for each new document created. It may includes format codes similar to the Advanced Format Task.
        {0} is replaced with a sequential number, beginning with 1, assigned to each document created.  {1}, {2}, etc. are replaced with the corresponding optional inputs.
        If left blank, each created document is given the original document's title plus its sequence number.
      </setting>
    </settings>
  </task>
  <task name="SplitTask">
    <short>
      Split text based on a delimiter.
    </short>
    <long>
      Split text based on a delimiter, such as a comma. For instance, if the input is equal to "Jones,Stephen", it will be split into "Jones" and "Stephen".
    </long>
    <inputs>
      <input>
        A single text input.  If it is multi-valued, only the first value is split.
      </input>
    </inputs>
    <outputs>
      <output multi="true">
        There may be one multi-valued output or two or more single-valued outputs.
        If there is one output, it is set to multiple values--one for each 'split' of the input text.
        If two or more outputs are specified then each output receives one 'split' of the input.  Thus, in the example above, the first output is set to "Jones" and the second is set to "Stephen".  Any additional outputs are set to an empty string.
        If there are two or more outputs, but fewer than there are split values, the additional split value(s) are ignored.  Thus, if the input is "Peter/Paul/Mary" (delimiter = '/') is split to two outputs, "Mary" is ignored.
      </output>
    </outputs>
    <settings>
      <setting name="Delimiter">
        The delimiter is one more characters which indicate where to split the input.

    </outputs>
    <settings>
      <setting name="OpCode">
        Operations include converting all letters to lower case or to upper case, trimming whitespace from the left or right, removing new line characters, replacing multiple spaces with a single space, and padding the string on the left or right with a single space.
        Multiple operations may be applied in a single task, in which case they are applied in the order shown.

    </settings>
  </task>
  <task name="SubstringTask">
    <short>
      Selects a substring from the input string.
    </short>
    <long>
      Select a specified number of characters from the input after skipping a certain number of characters.
      For instance, if the input is expected to be "Invoice: #####" where "#####" is some 5 digit number, this task can be used to isolate
      the number by skipping 9 characters (the word, Invoice, plus the colon and space) and taking 5.
    </long>
    <inputs>
      <input multi="true">String from which the substring is selected.  It may be multi-values, in which case a substring is found for each value of the input.</input>
